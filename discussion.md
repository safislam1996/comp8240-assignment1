Understanding Precision and Recall:
Precision is the proportion of correct positive predictions (True Positives) out of all positive predictions (True Positives + False Positives). High precision indicates that most of the predicted positive instances are correct.

$$ Precission = {TP \over TP+FP} $$
â€‹
Recall is the proportion of actual positives that were correctly identified. High recall means that the model is able to find most of the true positives.


$$ Recall = {TP \over TP+FN} $$
